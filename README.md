# One Week IoT
One Week IoT is a start-up created in October 2016 to help - as many people as we can - to learn the basics of IoT.

Why the basics and not some cutting-edge aspect of IoT? Because we know that normally the first step is the hardest one to take. Creating even a very basic end-to-end IoT scenario can be tricky for people with limited knowledge on electronics, networking and coding. 

We accepted the challenge of creating this end-to-end experience that would provide people with a device (real device, not any emulator) that would send data to a cloud service, and get commands from it. Along with the device, we would have a step-by-step online training that would lead people into this IoT journey.

Once the device was ready (it took us several iterations until we got to a viable prototype) and the course material was created we put that in practice by hosting several in person workshops to get feedback both on the class content but also about the device. 

Since we started teaching these IoT101 workshops we reached about 150 people with overwhelming positive feedback. It feels now we're ready to make this available and reach even more people! Now we're moving from the in-class experience to a digital one, and all learnings were incorporated to the material.

We hope you enjoy the journey!
