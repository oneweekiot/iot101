# One Week IoT
This is the official repository for the One Week IoT a start-up created to help teach IoT to as many people as we can.

Yeah, we know Iot is going to be BIG. I mean REALLY BIG, Gartner talks about trillions of devices in a gazillion-dollar business. 

We know this technology, as many other, can be a little tricky to get and taking the first step into understanding and having an A-HA moment is crucial to enable people not only to make use of IoT, but to create their own solutions to real world problems.
